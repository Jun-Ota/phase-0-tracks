<Release 0>

What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

=>I will start reading a chapter of a book about this topic. 
  And after that I will search words or concepts I did not understand or was not clear. Beraks are really important. I often get stuck. Sometimes it is because I do not understand the concept. If I do not understand that point and move on I get stuck soon. So taking a break and make sure I am understanding properly is very important to me.

<Release 1>
Learings from the book.
